# 2024 Worlds

The New Hampshire state competition had 46 teams competing, and [our team](../our-team/index.html) got first place! Since we won, we earned an invitation to the [2024 FIRST Championship](https://www.firstchampionship.org/), in Houston, April 17-20. For worlds, we are trying to patent our innovation project and upgrade our robot from EV3 to SPIKE to improve the robot. Worlds is in April and it’s in Houston, Texas.

## Competition Categories

1. **Robot Game**: Complete missions on the challenge board. This game seems like the main focus, but it isn’t the whole competition.
2. **Robot Design**: A presentation to tell judges about how your robot works, the inspiration, and why it works well.
3. **Innovation Project**: Find a solution to a problem in your community or even bigger problems.
4. **Core Values**: The most important category, showing teamwork. Our team got 100% in every category for core values.
